Pod Song (Addendum to Obibe's Descent)
@Helen

***

A further three days passed before the pod, now led by Tohora - a senior member of the pod who, like Obibe, had lived a long and eventful life - began to emerge from beneath the thickest part of the Patch. Although still not entirely clear of it, breathing became easier and the krill more plentiful. As the sun set, the pod began a new song, an epic tale of their journey through the Patch. Tohora was quiet as the song billowed and flowed around her, her attention focused on the part of the Ocean the Pod now moved through. The sea was not as clean as she'd hoped it might be and the krill not as tasty. She noticed, too, that the sea was not as deep as before and unfamiliar voices made a faint but distinct ululation, distant but unignorable. "Tomorrow", she thought, "We will seek out these sound makers, these singers of new songs". As the Moon rose, the pod settled in for the night, and slept.
